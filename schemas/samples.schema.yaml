        pattern: "^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*$"
        description: sample name/identifier. Duplicate over multiple rows for multiple fastq runs. sample name must start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and periods
    STARGenomeName:
        type: string
        description: Name of fasta/gtf pair used to align, as uniquely defined in STAR_Genome_List
